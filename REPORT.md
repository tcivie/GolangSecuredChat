# End-to-End Secured Chat Application (GolangSecuredChat)

## 1. Introduction

In an era where digital communication is ubiquitous, ensuring the privacy and security of online conversations has become paramount. This project aims to address this critical need by developing an end-to-end secured chat application. Our solution provides a robust platform for users to communicate securely, protecting their messages from potential eavesdroppers, including the server itself.

## 2. Background

The increasing frequency of data breaches and unauthorized access to personal communications has highlighted the importance of secure messaging systems. While many existing chat applications offer some level of security, they often fall short in providing true end-to-end encryption, leaving user data vulnerable at various points in the communication process.

Our project builds upon the concepts of asymmetric cryptography, symmetric key encryption, and secure communication protocols to create a comprehensive security solution. By implementing end-to-end encryption, we ensure that only the intended recipients can read the messages, keeping the content confidential even from the server facilitating the communication.

## 3. Project Design

### 3.1 Problem Statement

The main challenge addressed by this project is to create a chat application that ensures:

1. Secure user authentication without storing sensitive credentials on the server
2. End-to-end encryption of messages between users
3. Protection of user identities in the server database
4. Secure key exchange for establishing encrypted communication channels

### 3.2 Objectives

1. Implement a client-server architecture with TLS encryption for all network communications
2. Develop a user authentication system using public-key cryptography
3. Create a secure user registration process
4. Implement end-to-end encryption for all chat messages
5. Design a user-friendly interface for the chat application

### 3.3 Methodology

Our approach involves several key components:

1. **TLS Encryption**: All communication between clients and the server is encrypted using TLS, providing a secure channel for data transmission.

2. **Public-Key Authentication**: Users are authenticated using their public-private key pairs, eliminating the need for password storage on the server.

3. **One-Way Username Encryption**: Usernames are stored in the server database using one-way encryption to protect user identities.

4. **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages between users are encrypted using symmetric keys, which are securely exchanged using the users' public keys.

5. **Secure Key Exchange**: The application implements a secure protocol for exchanging symmetric keys between users, ensuring that even the server cannot access the conversation content.

## 4. Implementation

The project is implemented in Go, leveraging its strong security features and efficient concurrency model. The application is divided into client and server components, each with its own set of responsibilities.

### 4.1 Server Implementation

The server is responsible for:
- Managing user connections
- Facilitating secure user authentication
- Storing encrypted user information
- Forwarding encrypted messages between users

Key files:
- `server/cmd/main.go`: Entry point for the server application
- `server/internal/actions/`: Handlers for various message types
- `server/internal/db/sqlite.go`: Database management for user information

### 4.2 Client Implementation

The client handles:
- User interface
- Local key management
- Message encryption and decryption
- Secure communication with the server

Key files:
- `client/cmd/main.go`: Entry point for the client application
- `client/internal/model/`: Data models for client-side operations
- `client/internal/service/`: Services for handling various client functionalities
- `client/internal/view/`: User interface components

### 4.3 Encryption Implementation

The encryption process involves:
1. TLS for server-client communication
2. RSA for user authentication and initial key exchange
3. AES for symmetric encryption of chat messages

Relevant files:
- `client/internal/model/chatter.go`: Implements encryption/decryption logic
- `server/internal/util/utils.go`: Utilities for server-side cryptographic operations

## 5. Results and Analysis

The implemented chat application successfully achieves its security objectives:

1. **Secure Authentication**: Users can authenticate without exposing their private keys to the server.
2. **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages are encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.
3. **Identity Protection**: User identities are protected through one-way encryption in the server database.
4. **Secure Key Exchange**: Symmetric keys for message encryption are exchanged securely using public-key cryptography.

Performance testing shows that the additional security measures have minimal impact on the application's responsiveness, maintaining a smooth user experience while providing robust security.

## 6. Improvement Suggestions

While the current implementation provides a high level of security, there are several areas for potential improvement:

1. **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Implement a key rotation mechanism to provide perfect forward secrecy, ensuring that compromise of long-term keys does not compromise past session keys.

2. **Multi-Device Support**: Extend the system to support secure synchronization of messages across multiple devices for the same user.

3. **Group Chat Encryption**: Implement secure group chat functionality with efficient key management for multiple participants.

4. **Message Integrity Verification**: Add digital signatures to messages to verify the integrity and authenticity of each message.

5. **Automated Security Auditing**: Implement a system for regular automated security checks and alerts for any potential vulnerabilities.

## 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the feasibility of creating a highly secure chat application with end-to-end encryption. By leveraging modern cryptographic techniques and careful system design, we have created a solution that protects user privacy at every stage of communication.

The implemented improvements, particularly in the areas of perfect forward secrecy and multi-device support, would further enhance the security and usability of the application. As digital communication continues to play a crucial role in our daily lives, solutions like this will be essential in ensuring the privacy and security of personal and professional interactions.
